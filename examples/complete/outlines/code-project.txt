Objective: create a control system for an elevator

Requirement: test coverage

Components:
Server

 - Manages the elevator dispatch queue
 - Stores elevator state
Floor Call button
 - Submits a requests to elevator dispatch
 - Parameters
   - floor number
   - direction

 - Aware of its pending stops/direction and current floor #
 - Accepts floor number input (or times out)
 - Validates floor number input
 - On valid input, begins moving towards floor

Implementation
MVP
 - Server sends static HTML 
 - Floors dynamically generated with call buttons
 - Call button POSTs to elevator dispatch
 - One floor displays elevator 
 - Elevator displays whether moving or stopped
 - When stopped, elevator accepts input 
 - Input POSTs to elevator dispatch
 - Manually refresh page for updates

Simple SPA
 - Server sends HTML with floors, buttons
 - Convert buttons to ajax POST
 - Elevator widget 
    - Fetches dispatch data
    - Renders itself to the page
    - Handles DOM represenatation of travel
    - Validates input when stopped

Extensible SPA
 - Support multiple elevators via Collection

Routable SPA
 - Dynamically load elevator position at page load
